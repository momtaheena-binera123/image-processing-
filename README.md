Image Processing and Computer Vision Project
This project contains code for various image processing techniques and computer vision tasks using Python, specifically demonstrated in a Jupyter Notebook.

Project Overview
This repository provides a hands-on example of how to perform common image processing operations. It covers fundamental concepts from loading and displaying images to applying advanced filters and performing feature analysis. The purpose of this project is to serve as a learning resource and a practical demonstration of capabilities using popular Python libraries.

Core Functionality:

Reading and writing images in different formats.

Applying various filters, such as Gaussian blur and Canny edge detection.

Converting images between different color spaces (e.g., RGB to grayscale).

Performing basic image analysis and feature extraction.

Visualizing intermediate and final results using matplotlib.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
To run this project, you will need to have Python 3.x and the following libraries installed:

numpy

opencv-python

matplotlib

You can install these using pip:

pip install numpy opencv-python matplotlib

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)

Navigate to the project directory:

cd your-repository-name

Install the required packages (if you haven't already):

pip install -r requirements.txt

(Note: You will need to create a requirements.txt file by running pip freeze > requirements.txt if you don't have one already.)

Usage
This project is best used within a Jupyter environment. To run the notebook and see the code in action, follow these steps:

Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab from your terminal:

jupyter notebook

A browser window will open. Navigate to and open the 21201307_463L2_momtaheena_chowdhury.ipynb file from the file browser.

Run the cells sequentially to execute the code and see the outputs.
